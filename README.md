# nhttp

simple and fast http server based on mofuw.

**NOT WEB FRAMEWORK. THIS IS HTTP SERVER.**

but, if to develop web framework on nhttp, that is very easy.

**create http handler, and set to nhttp's handler, end. VERY EASY. What's difficult with this? HAHAHA**

## require
- Nim 0.19.0, or more version

## feature
- **easy install** can typing `nimble install https://github.com/2vg/nhttp`
- **cross platform** working Windows, macOS, Linux.
- **high scalable** easy create middleware.
- **very fast** using AsyncI/O, and some optimized code, so very high-performance.

## Todo
- [ ] SSL I/O
- [ ] hook handler
- [ ] multi-thread, single thread now (u-m, i'm looking for a good way because there are threadvar issues.)

etc, now working...
